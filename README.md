Hello World!

My Project here talks about the diiferent types of Functions in Dart

1. Void Functions.
2. Functions with a return type.
3. Functions that takes in parameters(manditory).
4. Functions that takes in optional parameters.
5. Getters and Setters.

In the this file I will share examples of each of this functions.
